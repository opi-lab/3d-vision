# Computer Vision

### Second semester 2016

Andrés Marrugo, PhD
*Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar*

##  Aims and Scope

This semester course is an introduction to computer vision. It is aimed at graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. We will focus on the practical and theoretical aspects of techniques in computer vision.

At the end of the lectures, one would be able to:

- Have clear idea of challenges in computer vision due to increasing use in mobile applications.
- Understand many different computer vision algorithms and approaches.
- Implement computer vision algorithms for mid-level vision tasks.
