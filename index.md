##  Aims and Scope

This semester course is an introduction to computer vision. It is aimed at graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. We will focus on the practical and theoretical aspects of techniques in computer vision.

At the end of the lectures, one would be able to:

- Have clear idea of challenges in metrology due to increasing trend towards miniaturisation.
- Understand many different metrological devices and principles and applicability of those devices.
- Understand the process and provide metrological solution for the improvement of a process.

## Outline

This is a new course, this website will be updated as we go along.

### Lecture 1: Introduction

We will be discussing the main aspects about metrology and why it is so important in manufacturing.
