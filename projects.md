## Project proposals

The following are several of the project proposals that you will work until the end of semester. You must choose one of the following topics by **November 3rd**. Please email my with the topic you have chosen and the team members. If you would like to do something different, please email me and we can talk about it.

1. **Visual Eye-Tracking**
	- Let’s say I am an individual with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and I can only use my eyes to communicate with the outside world. While there exist systems that implement eye-tracking, I don’t want to spend $X,000 on such a system as it’s very expensive and I believe a simple camera with computer vision algorithms should be able to take care of this task. The task would be to track what pixels a human is looking at in an image or video.
2. **Hawk-eye tracking**
	- Implement a hawk-eye ball tracking stereo system as the ones used in tennis matches. You can use a table tennis ball, make a line with duck tape and throw it. We need the trajectory of the centroid of the ball. The tracking might need additional filtering. Kalman filter? 
3. **Augmented Reality (AR)** 
	- Project 3D objects (from CAD?) onto flat surface. Best if done on video with moving camera. You can use a sheet of paper or a TAG on top of flat surface for reference. The basis of this problem is to estimate pose of camera using information from the reference plane. You can use the five point target developed in the course.
5. **3D skeleton reconstruction** 
	- Choose an object (it could be a toy) or a person an place distinctive markers that would enable you to obtain a 3D skeleton of the object by 3D triangulation methods. You need a stereo or multi-view system.

### General Guidelines

The general requirement is that you implement the code at least with a simulated object, but best if you acquire images in a controlled environment. You may reuse code from other sources, but cite them properly. Your final report should be between 6 - 8 pages using the IEEE template. 

#### Report

The following is a suggested structure for the report:

- Title, Author(s)
- Abstract: It should not be more than 300 words
- Introduction: this section introduces your problem, and the overall plan for approaching your problem
- Background/Related Work: This section discusses relevant literature for your project
- Approach: This section details the framework of your project. Be specific, which means you might want to include equations, figures, plots, etc
- Experiment: This section begins with what kind of experiments you're doing, what kind of dataset(s) you're using, and what is the way you measure or evaluate your results. It then shows in details the results of your experiments. By details, we mean both quantitative evaluations (show numbers, figures, tables, etc) as well as qualitative results (show images, example results, etc).
- Conclusion: What have you learned? Suggest future ideas.
- References: This is absolutely necessary.
